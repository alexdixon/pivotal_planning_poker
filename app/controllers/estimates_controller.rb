  # Security note:
  # #detect_story checks to make sure that the user has access to this story in PT before modifying estimate.  All client
  # actions will raise exception if access to this resource on PT is denied, so this provides some level of
  # security against clients who may try to set estimates on another users' game.  Note that we don't do anything
  # about users who try to grab the json results of other users' estimation sessions, as this would be too much
  # overhead on requests that are used in polling.
